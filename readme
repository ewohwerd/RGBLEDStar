This is a project playing around with WS2812B LED Pixels (AKA NeoPixels) and an Arduino. The only other hardware being used is a rotary encoder with pushbutton.
Library Dependencies:
ClickEncoder for Arduino: https://github.com/0xPIT/encoder/tree/arduino
Adafruit Neopixel: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel

My pixels are weirdly aligned, because they're actually in a 25 point Moravian Star, aligned like this:

          |24|
|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|            
|09|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|  
|01|02|03|04|05|06|07|08|      
          |00|
          
Known issues: 
My method for a software sleep mode is apparently crashing about 10 minutes in, meaning it's not working very well.
There are a number of rough concepts I've mapped out in my head but not yet implemented.
